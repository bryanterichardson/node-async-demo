# node-async-demo
Small Demo of Async Architecture for Beginners.
This was used in demo'ing the power of async to those curious


### What's Included
- Simple API that allows you to control **minimum** response time
- Sample usages showing the advantages of sync vs async


### Other resources

- My drawing of an event loop style architecture. Used to demonstrate code live:

- Demo of JS event loop and how that differs from traditional event loop:

### How to Use:

`npm install`

`npm start`

`*Send requests to API using the options "delay" query param*`

The order I prefer to teach these concepts:
- eventLoop.js
- eventLoop2.js
- trickyEventLoop.js
- syncRequest.js
- asyncRequest.js
